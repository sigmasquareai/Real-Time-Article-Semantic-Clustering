All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?"
"Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... So that's the way it's done."
"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?"
"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago."
"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate."
"People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us."" I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts."
Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this."
"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah."
"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?"
"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes."
"OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch."
"No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided."
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?"
"Question. How long do we have to... Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?"
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that."
"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler."
"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good."
"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?"
"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation."
We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on."
"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it."
"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise."
"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional."
"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP."
"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable."
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?"
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it."
"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then."
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings."
"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."
"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry."
"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp."
"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything."
"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand."
"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?"
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules."
"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food."
"Discipline. Kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop."
"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O."
Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all."
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?"
"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to..."
"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first."
"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam."
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
"You been X'd punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you."
"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, ""Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked."
"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited."
"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, ""100% post-consumer content."" What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second."
"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... Hello? Thanks, Dwight."
"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?"
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?"
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
"Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance."
"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race."
"Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind."
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
"Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?"
"Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out."
"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox."
"Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK."
"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?"
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess."
"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... I take care of my kid!"
"Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness."
"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged."
"Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge."
"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?"
"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit."
"Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need."
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't."
"""I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..."" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ""...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."" He's going to lose it when he reads that."
"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you."
"""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears."
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape."
"Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace."
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um..."
"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian."
"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on."
"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States."
"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?"
"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?"
"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done."
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
"Pam, come on. ""I like your food."" Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real."
"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver."
"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court."
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
"Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my..."
"All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority."
"Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you."
"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food."
"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai."
"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice."
"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway."
"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the..."
"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist."
"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works."
"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?"
"You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan."
"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice."
"Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time."
"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers."
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?"
"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it."
"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train."
"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine."
"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already."
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead."" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead."
"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?"
"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the..."
"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call."
"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?"
"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?"
"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies."
"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will."
"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?"
"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?"
"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, ""Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him."
"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do."
"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential."
"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office."
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob."
"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend."
"I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?"
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?"
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
"Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride."
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?"
"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?"
"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them."
"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?"
"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!"
"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. ""Count Choculitis"""
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
"Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything."
"Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert."
"Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?"
"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan."
"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?"
"Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism."
"This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day."
"Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it."
"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options."
"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered."
"You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s."
"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?"
"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday."
"Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?"
"All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!"
"When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo."
"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?"
"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired."" ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so..."
"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work."
"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?"
"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!"
"Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek."
"I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind."
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious."
"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so..."
"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?"
"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out."
"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected..."
"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me."
"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way."""
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground."
"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?"
"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam."
"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away."
"Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, ""Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."""
"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone..."
"Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking..."
"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off."
"Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor."
"My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if..."
"No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25."
"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so..."
"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?"
"Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, ""These people are my friends."" But he's all like, ""This is confidential. You can't tell anybody."" But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything."
"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me."
"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend."
"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies."
"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside."
"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?"
"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time."
"OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday."
"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there."
"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything."
"Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet."
"Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box."
"No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone."
"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me."
"You looked freaked, man. We said ""Surprise."" You were, like, ""What?"" ""What the hell's goin' on here?"" Good cake. Why don't you have some?"
"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good."
"Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic."
"Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that..."
"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal."
"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?"
"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time."
"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give."
"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so..."
"It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, ""However many dollars per mile."""
"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?"
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
"""Happy Bird-day"" Um... ""Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still."""
"That was Stanley. ""Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam."""
"This is from Michael. ""Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age."""
"You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... ""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?"
"That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me."
"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that."
"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25."
"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back."
"I want it to be like... ""Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?"" ""Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous."" ""Well, guess what, that was Michael Scott."" ""But it was anonymous, how do you know?"" ""Because I'm him."""
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and...... spy on our other branch. No no no.
"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover."
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um..."
"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves."
"That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson."
"All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent."
"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, ""This might be kinda fun."" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together."
"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team."
"No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior."
"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar."
"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that."
"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim."
"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?"
"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding."
"All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right."
"And here we have ""Mister Roger's Neighborhood."" Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs."
"And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs."
"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!"
"No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years."
"Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago."
"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way."
"I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings."
"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course."
"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time."
"Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart."
"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?"
"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?"
"Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying."
"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good."
"Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?"
"Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!"
"Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday."
"Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you."
"Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here."
"Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along."
"Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it."
"All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?"
"Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys."
"Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?"
"Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car."
Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! Oh... Here we go! Who's on him? Somebody get him!
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. Here we go. Three! Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!"
"Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go."
"When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone."
"Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually."
"Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah..."
"Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter..."
"All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!"
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
"Shoot, shoot it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up."
"No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there."
"Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly."
"It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face."
"You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word."
"Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend."
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
"Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!"
"Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality."
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
"Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?"
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
"Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else."
"Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?"
"All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse."
"Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you."
"Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
"Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace."
"I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses."
"Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn."
"So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day."
"Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman."
"I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating."
"This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be."
"No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it."
"So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here."
"Not it's not, there's some in the straw. There, now you may throw it out."
"Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks."
"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here."
"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?"
"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
"I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move."
"I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?"
"Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?"
"Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?"
"You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy."
"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know."
Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
"It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with."
"I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook."
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
"Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work."
"I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule"
"This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay."
"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning."
"Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really."
"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems."
"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss."
"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there."
"Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions."
"Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back."
"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them."
"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her."
"Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good."
"Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?"
"Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens."
Oh! That was really. This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
"Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?"
"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?"
"Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones."
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!"
"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!"
"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp."
"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves."
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
"No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not."
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot..."
"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?"
"Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel."
"I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that."
"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and..."
"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
"That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one."
"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So..."
"We got to see Ping. And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. Which for me, has ruined them for life."
"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you."
"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?"
"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky."
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy."
"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say ""Don't go there"" but that's... lame."
"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling."
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
"Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?"
"Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, someone had eaten all of them."
"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat."
"Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights."
"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost."
"He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!"
"I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!"
"A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing..."
"We have a strict policy here not to over serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again."
"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
"...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of..."
"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion."
"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less."
"Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?"
"Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home."
"Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So..."
"No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this."
"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that."
"Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N."
"Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense."
"This is a little character I like to do, it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. ""Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."" Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting."
"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, ""world's longest engagement"", um, we're all expecting it, you know?"
"That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier."
"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom."
"Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now."
"Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us."
"Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. Devon!"
"""The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello."" Card!"
"The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like."
"Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
"Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks."
"Shut it. Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight."
"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy."
"And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts..."
"Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The ""Hottest in the Office"" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!"
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
"And the ""Tight Ass"" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down."
"The ""Spicy Curry"" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go."
"It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go."
"Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh..."
"I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the ""Don't Go in There After Me"" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So..."
"Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year."
"So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin."
...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
"It is the ""Whitest Sneakers"" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!"
"Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too."
"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time."
"Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?"
"I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer."
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
"There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh..."
"Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... Whup! Come on! Hey!"
"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother."
"Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him."
"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner."
"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So..."
"Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why."
"Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent."
"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on."
"Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there."
"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody."
"I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch."
"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to."
"Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?"
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
"Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?"
"Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot."
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!"
"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?"
"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away."
"Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later."
"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it."
"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake."
"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?"
"Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day."
"Well, those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?"
"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense."
"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with."
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
"Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back."
"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over."
"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?"
Exactly! Mmwwah! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?"
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
"Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR."
"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have."
"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it."
"What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work? Would that be crossing the line?"
"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?"
"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?"
"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?"
"Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly."
"Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that."
"In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'"
"Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. This is..."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay."
"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure."
"Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour."
"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another."
"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things."
"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so..."
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
"Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself."
"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems."
"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so..."
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
"So a guy goes home, tells his wife, ""Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery."" She goes, ""Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?"" He goes, ""I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!"" Boom!"
"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So..."
"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast."
"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. ""Home Alone,"" ""Risky Business."" Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do."
"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate."
"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you."
"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so."
"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers."
"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?"
"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him."
"Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly."
"Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you."
"These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal."
"I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment."
"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal."
"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work."
"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart"
"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?"
"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you."
"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?"
I... Just... Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?"
Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.
"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home."
"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something."
"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um."
"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x."
"It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles."
"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?"
"Yeah, I got a game. It's called ""work hard so my kids can go to college."""
"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall."
"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed."
This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids."
"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system."
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live."
"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?"
"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens."
"Yes! Phyllis! Phyllis, just put your foot right through here. Right through the flonk."
"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't..."
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down."
"Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom."
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today."
"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent."
"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities."
"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone."
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis."
"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok."
"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch."
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst."
"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet."
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second."
"Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?"
"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think."
"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!"
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
"Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs..."
"Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find."
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
"Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh."
"Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto."
"Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing."
"Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school."
"Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans."
"I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!"
"We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!"
"Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. Desert Island. Five movies. Go."
"I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car."
"Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?"
"Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!"
"Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands."
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
"Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?"
"Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!"
"Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer."
"Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers."
"Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges."
"I don't want to be like ""a guy"" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the ""crossword puzzle guy"". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the ""something guy""."
"Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?"
"Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a..."
"Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question"
"Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?"
"Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County..."
"Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... ."
"Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable."
"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for..."
"All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?"
"When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me."
"Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks."
"You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about."
"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will."
"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all."
"I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?"
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
"Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then..."
"Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back."
"You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'."
"Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted."
"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway."
"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them."
"Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?"
"Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?"
"Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?"
"Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling."
"Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business."
"Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen."
What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. Okay."
"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and..."
"Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go."
"Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day."
"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings."
"Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!"
"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?"
"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out."
"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food."
"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year."
"You're a lion. Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these."
"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about."
"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do."
"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?"
"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch."
I am a Sith Lord. Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
"Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day."
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?"
"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers."
"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it."
"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats."
"Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything."
"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India."
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
"Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh, yeah. Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott."
"Um... Whoa. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay."
"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry."
"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just..."
"Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?"
"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most."
"So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis..."
"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real."
"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge."
"This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?"
"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills."
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma."
"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it."
"Alright. Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal..."
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
"Toby? Mm hmm. I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth..."
"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop."
"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye."
"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?"
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you."
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man."
"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight."
"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!"
"Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot."
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
"Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model."
"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it."
"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now."
"You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks."
"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo."
"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei."
"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm."
"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information."
"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier."
"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is."
"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. ""Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority."" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you."
"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?"
"Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?"
"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you."
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man."
"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out."
"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link."
"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up."
"Oh, queer... eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it."
"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass."
"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight."
"Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not."
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael."
"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?"
"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough."
"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22."
"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight..."
"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now."
"Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?"
"Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner."
"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!"
"You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points."
"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? ""Raging Bull."" Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag."
"Seven new messages. First New Message. ""Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein."" Next new message. ""Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!"""
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
"Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?"
"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man."
"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?"
"Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie."
"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date."
"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic."
"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays."
"Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today."
"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?"
"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. Years."
"Radisson just gives out this vibe, ""Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson"". It's kind of snooty. So."
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner."
"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me."
"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting."
"Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now."
"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. Adios!"
"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?"
"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead."
No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?
"Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-"
"I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?"
"Ok, it's done. Actually, Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done."
"Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo."
"Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me."
"Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-"
"Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?"
"Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like."
"First guy says ""Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn"". And the second guy says, ""Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort"". And the third guy says ""I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe""."
"Ohhh no! Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!"
"Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones."
"Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy."
"We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match."
"That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault."
"Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters."
"Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!"
"Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of ""Oklahoma"" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good."
"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?"
"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. Wait, who's Dwigt?"
"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops."
"Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now."
"That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry?"
"So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her."
"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh."
"He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind"
"You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists."
"You said ""World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!"""
"I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer."
"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich."
"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices."
"I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts."
Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.
Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan?
"No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So."
"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all?"
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question
Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry.
"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x."
"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?"
"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect."
"With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate."
"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."" First impressions?"
"And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-"
"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual."
"At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?"
"But then she goes on to say ""that will be our only topic of discussion"". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words."
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed
"Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-"
"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you."
"Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?"
"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you""."
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise."
"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease."
"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid."
Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
"Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses."
"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry."
"Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact."
"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'."
"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn."
I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah?
"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's."
"No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch."
"Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's."
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A ""Michael-idea"" folder?"
That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?"
"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started."
"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p."
"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?"
"...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon."
"We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?"
"You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business."
"I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because ""Oh, I regret that."" But, ""Wait, I'm still gonna call you."" But, but, ""We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."" But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business."
"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?"
"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy."
"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night"
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one"
"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally."
"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody."
"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."
"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. ""You need to do something about your coffee breath""-"
"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box."
"Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow."
"""Don't sleep with your boss""? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?"
"Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same"
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word
That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise."
"Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light?"
"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said ""Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of""."
"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together."
"It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Oh my God. Ohhh. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here."
"You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry!"
"Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected..."
"Oh sorry, we're not going as a group, it's just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing."
"Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it."
"Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?"
"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on."
"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over."
"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That's strong!"
"Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket! Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?"
"Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---"
"It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh."
"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke."
"Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me..."
"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails."
"Try ""profits"". No! Try ""Michael Scott"". ""Michael"" ""boss"" and ""funny"". [Sadiq (IT guy) types"
Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
"The problem is that when people hear the term ""big brother"", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother."
"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately."
Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... If you guys see anything... ?
"Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with."
"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?"
"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory."
"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No."
"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler."
"Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup."
"Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors."
"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. He is very real."
"Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or..."
"One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out."
"Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-"
"It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go."
"Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?"
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
"Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy."
"Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice."
"Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. He has no idea!"
"Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy."
"Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here."
Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
"Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to."
"Ok, Michael. And... anybody? How about Mary-Beth? Come on. Ok, so you start us off Mary-Beth."
I'm supposed to meet my doctor here? Have ya seen him? He's a very angry midget.
"Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't ya!? Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds. I been on to you and your little friends for weeks. Boom! Boom! Boom!"
"Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going."
"Just, I want you to get rid of all your guns and give them to me. Great."
"You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts."
"Yeah, you don't have to, ummm. Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all."
"No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune."
"I promise it's worthit . Ooo, I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading."
I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to."
"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!"
"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight."
"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up."
"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! Nice, huh?"
"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year."
"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about."
"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel."
"Yes, I got those cute little ones. Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?"
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
"Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?"
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that."
"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive."
"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody."
"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time."
"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?"
"Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael."
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain."
"I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't."
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons."
"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, ""Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."""
"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag."
"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away."
"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?"
"So Phyllis is basically saying, ""Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth."" I gave Ryan an iPod."
"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift."
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.
"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt."
"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now."
"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift."
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
"I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful."
"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm."
"""In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."""
"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand."
"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot."
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people."
"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!"
"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame."
"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?"
"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?"
"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .."
"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle."
"Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money."
"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?"
"The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week."
"Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done."
"Anybody making out in here? Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here?"
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know."
"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .."
"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside."
"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy."
"""It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."""
"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack."
This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan."
"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say."
"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course."
"Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!"
"Last year, Michael's theme was ""Bowl over the Competition!"" So guess where we went."
"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?"
"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace."
"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!"
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck."
"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse."
"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship."
"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan."
"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party."
"I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. Hi, welcome aboard."
"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose."
"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!"
"They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat."
"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight."
"Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here..."
I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
"Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?"
Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
"You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?"
"No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!"
"Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!"
"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers."
"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support."
"Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!"
All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats."
"All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!"
"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!"
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! Darryl! Darryl!
"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?"
"Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm."
"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour."
"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice."
"Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her."
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!"
"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?"
"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!"
"We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!"
"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a..."
"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about."
"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet."
"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so..."
"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan..."
